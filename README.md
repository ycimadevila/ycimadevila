About me
I'm a programmer in the day and a guitar player in the night. I started both disciplines in Cuba, one in the halls of University of Havana, where I knew the 2 best professor that I ever had, Alejandro Piad and Alfredo Somoza, and other in the streets of Havana where I knew my brothers from other mothers.

I came to the United States to continue my studies, to seek freedom and build my future on this land.

In my free time I’m mostly learning about new technologies and frameworks, trying to solve challenging programing problems, creating personal projects or contributing with others, and recording songs in my room.

Believes and thoughts
❤️ I really believe in good, I think that if you have the necessary conditions to help someone, then being good is a duty.

❤️ Nothing is free and it is our duty to know when to make the sacrifices to move forward in our search for happiness.

❤️ I really stand for the free speech, everyone should have the chance to express themselves and carry on with the consequences of their words, and change their mind if they figure out that they were wrong.

❤️ Respect is not acceptance, we can disagree but collaborate together, even have a friendship… except if you think that PHP and JavaScript are the best programming languages, that’s immediately a war declaration, with the only exception of my fiancée 😂.

❤️ Forgiveness is hard, but cleans our souls.

❤️ I had good mentors that taught me to love what I do. That’s why I love to teach others with the same passion.
